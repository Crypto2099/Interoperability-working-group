**Minutes:**

* Charles Augu introduced https://smart-chain.fr/
* Dima Brook  introduced https://xp.network/ - https://bridge.xp.network/ - NFT bridge with more than 18 bridges in the ecosystem, are looking to bridge into Cardano. They are not a marketplace, just a bridge so users can work with any marketplace.
* As new members joined it was highlighted that the objective and mission of this working group was to provide ecosystem support in terms of technology, business partnership, risk framework, etc.. to any solution providers aiming to build a bridge on Cardano. Bridge, as interoperability architecture, is critical to the Cardano ecosystem growth, but  also a vulnerable building block in the multichain world. This Bridge Working Group endeavors to share the best practice, high standard security and governance in this mission critical.
* Current status on Multichain integration to Cardano:
    * Integration in Testnet between Fantom and Cardano is available to users now
    * Very good feedback has been received from the members of this working group and the suggestions have been taken into consideration. Looking forward to hearing from more feedback from the current and new members
    * Looking for formal auditors is challenging as integration with Cardano has no online scripts, is all off-chain and Golang in the MPC network.
    * The current plan is to continue working with the technical members from the WG on the code review and look for auditors
    * Multichain proposal will be updated in the WG github with link, designs, etc.. so everything is available for the community to comment
* Current status on Rosen Bridge - https://github.com/rosen-bridge
    * Code and Repos are public
    * Trying to deploy to Ergo and Cardano Mainnet for a soft launch with test tokens for a couple of weeks to confirm security and integrity of the bridge.
    * Soft launch is currently plan for the next 2 or 3 weeks
* A new proposal was mentioned re: tokenomics, more specific on Levering the SPO network for bridge security.
* It mentioned that a “bridge working group” repo was created for the members of this working group to add proposals that they would like to discuss.
